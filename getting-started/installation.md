# ðŸš€ Installation

### Setting up Jetstream

This package assumes you have installed Jetstream in your project. If not, head over to the [Jetstream website](https://jetstream.laravel.com) for installation steps.

### Installing Cashierstream

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require renoki-co/jetstream-cashier-billing-portal
```

Next, publish the stubs, Laravel Cashier, Cashier Register, Cashierstream, and other related files for your choice:

```bash
php artisan billing-portal:install inertia stripe
```

### Installing Laravel Cashier

Make sure to have prepared your models to use Cashier as explained in the [Cashier documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/billing), including the billable traits and tables. Cashierstream will only install the appropriate packages in your composer file.

### Add Stripe Checkout scripts

Cashierstream uses Stripe Checkout to ease the process of handling subscriptions.

You should do is to add the [Stripe Javascript SDK code](https://stripe.com/docs/js/including) **before** the `app.js` import in your `app.blade.php` file:

```markup
<script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>
<script src="{{ mix('js/app.js') }}" defer></script>
```

### Set up webhooks

Since Cashierstream uses Stripe Checkout, it's a must to have webhooks enabled so you can catch incoming subscriptions and modifications that happen in the Stripe Billing Portal.

Read more about it here: [https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/billing#handling-stripe-webhooks](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/billing#handling-stripe-webhooks)

The webhook should be configure to receive the following Stripe events:

* `customer.subscription.created`
* `customer.subscription.updated`
* `customer.subscription.deleted`
* `customer.updated`
* `customer.deleted`
* `invoice.payment_action_required`
* `invoice.payment_succeeded`
